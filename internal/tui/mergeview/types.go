// Package mergeview implements the interactive wizard used by `gl-stack merge`.
//
// The wizard walks the user through three selection steps — choosing how far up
// the stack to merge (a bottom-anchored checkbox list), picking the merge
// method, and confirming — then shows a live progress view while the
// asynchronous merge runs on GitLab. Because a stack merge is atomic, the
// progress view reports a single aggregate outcome: all selected PRs merge, or
// none do.
//
// The async merge submit/poll calls are injected as SubmitFunc/PollFunc so the
// wizard stays decoupled from the GitLab client and is easy to test.
