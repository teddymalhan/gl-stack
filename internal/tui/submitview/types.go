// Package submitview implements the interactive single-screen TUI used by
// `gl-stack submit` to create a stack of merge requests. A left-hand timeline
// lists the stack and lets the user choose which branches without a PR should
// become PRs; the right-hand editor drafts each PR's title, description, and
// ready/draft state before a single batch submit.
//
// The package builds on the shared Charm components in internal/tui/shared and
// reuses the branch display data loaded by internal/tui/stackview. The submit
// command supplies the per-PR overrides this package produces; the underlying
// push/create/relink engine is unchanged.
